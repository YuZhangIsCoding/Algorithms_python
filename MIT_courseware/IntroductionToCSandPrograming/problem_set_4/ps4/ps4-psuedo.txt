Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
for shift in from 0 to 26
    decode with -shift
    flag = 0
    for word in decoded string
        if word is not a word:
            flag = 1
            break
    if flag == 0: 
        return decoded message
return "no shift found"
