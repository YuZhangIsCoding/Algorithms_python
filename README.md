# Python codes

This repository contains some codes that I learned when I first learned python.

Thanks to MIT open courseware for the online sources. Currently studied 2 CS related courses:
* Introduction to Computer Science and Programming (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/)
* Introduction to Algorithms (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm)
